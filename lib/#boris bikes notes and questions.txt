1 	OK

2 	OK

3 	2 new methods, working_bikes and broken_bikes.  Available_bikes to return the concatenation of those two. What does 'interact with the van' mean?

4		Yes, it counts all bikes whether or not they are broken.  We may introduce more categories for bikes, we do want simply to be able to count them all.

5		What should the van be able to do?

		- check if a station has broken bikes 
		- pick up broken bikes from a station, up to its capacity
		- dock all broken bikes at the garage. Note broken bikes are fixed automagically.
		- check if the garage has fixed bikes
		- pick up fixed bikes from the garage, up to its capacity
		- dock fixed bikes with a station, up to the station's capacity

6		Can we do this without doing 5?

7		Van class.  Van moves.  Extra methods?  Dunno

8		Probably good to change; release by default fixed bikes from garage to van, broken bikes from station to van

9		What kind of scenarios?  Should we cater for a van being struck by a bolt of lightning, and should we blame some of the people in this room?

10	Refactoring?  What, My Perfect Code?!  There's a song title.
